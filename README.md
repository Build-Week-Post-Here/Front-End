# Front-End

### Tuesday

- push prettierrc to the repo
  ~~- figure out routing for both login and registration, not sure how to do it with redux~~
  ~~- need to access the components history prop inside the actions folder~~
- looking to do recommended posts, and get request to get that back from the system
- PostForm and submit a post to the backend

## Questions to Backend

1. What is a recommendation exactly? At the bare minimum it has the URL, subreddit name, link?

- what information would I need to have styling done? Do they have any of the following?
  - primary/secondary color of subreddit?
  - customized png of the robot? (or can I get that from the URL of the subreddit itself)
  - banner image (size it down with opacity to mimic the subreddit)

2. Does the backend require the username/email?

3. Is there a way to access an individual users saved post with a fetch? Otherwise I'll have to render that post solely in the single draft view /

4.
